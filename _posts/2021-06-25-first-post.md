### Multimedia&Lab course hint-based colorization in spring semester 2021,Department of software, Gachon Uni. 

Our team ranked 1st place of challenge

CVIP Lab in Gachon Uni. provided leader board to check the real-time rank and evalutaion criterion for challenge.

This was initial trial of Deep learning challenge in Multimedia&Lab course

Prof. Yongju Jung and other research assistants educated and guided  student to use Pytorch environments. Therefore every 11 team submit their own results and got their ranks.



Our team ( espectially me ) used various models for training. 
1. U-net
2. Attention U-net
3. Residual Attention U-net
4. Residual Attention U-net
5. Our model

The Architecture of our model :

I referenced 4 papers below 
Referenced Paper
1. U-Net Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation : <https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597>.   
2. Attention U-Net Learning Where to Look for the Pancreas : <https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03999>      
3. Real-Time User-Guided Image Colorization with Learned Deep Priors : <https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02999>.  
4. Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition : <https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385>.   

The main purpose of these project is winning the in course challenge so we overfited the model. Therefore we don't know our model is efficient to general data or not.

So if you interested in my model please visit my github repository.
