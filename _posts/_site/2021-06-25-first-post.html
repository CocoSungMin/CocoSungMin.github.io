<p>CVIP Lab in Gachon Uni. provided leader board to check the real-time rank and evalutaion criterion for challenge.</p>

<p>This was initial trial of Deep learning challenge in Multimedia&amp;Lab course</p>

<p>Prof. Yongju Jung and other research assistants educated and guided  student to use Pytorch environments. Therefore every 11 team submit their own results and got their ranks.</p>

<p>Our team ( espectially me ) used various models for training.</p>
<ol>
  <li>U-net</li>
  <li>Attention U-net</li>
  <li>Residual Attention U-net</li>
  <li>Residual Attention U-net</li>
  <li>Our model</li>
</ol>

<p>The Architecture of our model :

<p>The main purpose of these project is winning the in course challenge so we overfited the model. Therefore we donâ€™t know our model is efficient to general data or not.</p>

<p>So if you interested in my model please visit my github repository.</p>
